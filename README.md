# Arkanoid Game
This project is a classic Arkanoid game, implemented in Java. The objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks on the screen by bouncing a ball with a paddle, while preventing the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen.

The game includes multiple levels, and the difficulty increases as you progress. You can control the paddle with the keyboard to hit the ball and aim for the bricks.
